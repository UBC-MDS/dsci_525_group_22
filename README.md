# Machine Learning Application in Rainfall Prediction
## An exploration of Big Data challenges

In this project we will be building and deploying a machine learning model in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on [this large dataset (~6 GB)](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the challenges of working with large datasets and the tools currently available to alleviate those challenges.

We will begin by wrangling the data and performing some EDA, while also demonstrating the limits of personal computing technology in this process. We will then move the process to the cloud and move forward choosing, training and tuning an appropriate machine learning model on the data while also improving our data management and cloud computing approach.
